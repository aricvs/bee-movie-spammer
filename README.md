# bee-movie-spammer
A Python program using PyWhatKit  to spam non-beelievers with the script from the best movie ever

It requires PyWhatKit, the requirements are in the requirements.txt

This is a joke Python program that you can use to spam your friends via WhatsApp with line by line of the Bee Movie's entire script, the script file was taken from here: https://gist.github.com/MattIPv4/045239bc27b16b2bcf7a3a9a4648c08a

Make sure that you have logged in to WhatsApp Web on your default browser. I would also recommend that you open it before running the script and sync your messages if you haven't done so today, otherwise the script may not work.
